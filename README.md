## AssetApp
React Native Project with Typescript, Redux, UI-Kitten, and React Navigation 6.

## Project Description
This is a React Native mobile application that allows you to view fictitious stock prices for companies. The app has tab-based navigation, with login and registration screens, and a dashboard for displaying the stock values. The project is built with Typescript for better type checking and Redux for managing the application state. The UI is developed with UI-Kitten, a pre-built styled component library, and navigation is managed with React Navigation 6.
